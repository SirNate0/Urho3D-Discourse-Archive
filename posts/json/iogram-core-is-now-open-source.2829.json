The root was always one output. From that, i walked to all leaves, checking if the node was runnable (by checking if all required ports were connected), and ran an execute() method on the nodes. Each node implemented the execute() method differently. My actual execute() code was just building a virtual shader, literally by copying shader code strings to a buffer. When i was finished with all nodes, i just executed the shader code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould you elaborate on your approach? It would be very enlightening to see other approaches on this.
