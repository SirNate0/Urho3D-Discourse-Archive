What we don’t try to do, is simulate bullets as dynamic or kinematic rigidbodies, because Bullet starts to do weird things when the size of an object is smaller than a tennis ball, or bigger than a bus, or moving very fast - the numbers get too big, or too small, for the default single-precision floating point numbers. There is an option called CCD we can enable (continuous collision detection) which can help reduce “tunneling” for fast-moving and/or small rigidbodies, but it comes at some cost in terms of processing.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":8,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-03-09T03:08:10.828Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":7,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":30.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":4991,"topic_slug":"precision-of-physics-engine-for-gunsmithing-simulation","display_username":"Leith Ketchell","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"suspended user","title_is_group":false,"reply_to_user":{"username":"mvendra","name":"","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e47774/{size}.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":1}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1098,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":28841,"name":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","username":"Modanung","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/modanung/{size}/3290_2.png","created_at":"2019-03-09T07:05:08.287Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Leith\" data-post=\"8\" data-topic=\"4991\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/leith/40/2384_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e Leith:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullet starts to do weird things when the size of an object is smaller than a tennis ball, or bigger than a bus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think this can be better understood as Bullet having a maximum \u003cem\u003erelative scale range\u003c/em\u003e of \u003ccode\u003ebus:tennisball\u003c/code\u003e.
