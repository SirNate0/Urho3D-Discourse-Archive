Using -p with no path tells Urho3DPlayer.exe that there are no resource directories, but it doesn’t tell it not to try to look for the stuff it needs in CoreData. All the basic ramp textures for lights, the built-in shaders, the default render-path, etc… are found in CoreData. It still needs those to run correctly, you just aren’t letting it find them.

I mean, all that work is done for you, why go through the trouble?
