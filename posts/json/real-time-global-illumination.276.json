To be honest HBAO should just compliment a better GI approach as the screen-space ones don’t look too convincing. Two dynamic approaches that I really like are here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/~dachsbcn/download/lpv.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003evis.uni-stuttgart.de/~dachsb … ad/lpv.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPros: It can be shoe-horned into a SM3.0 renderer like Urho3D, it just needs to render to a 3D texture and the shadow map pass needs to be a multiple render target to produce albedo+normal passes for reflective shadow maps. Particles can be lit with this and look volumetric, some kind of SSS as well. It would use a few cascaded 3D textures similar to how shadows cascade.\u003cbr\u003e\nCons: Specular won’t work with it only single bounce diffuse. Light leaking on thin walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/layered-reflective-shadow-maps-for-voxel-based-indirect-illumination\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003esoftware.intel.com/en-us/articl … lumination\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPros: Similar benefits that LPVs provide in addition glossy specular highlights can be made with it as well, and it’s more accurate to LPV for single bounces.\u003cbr\u003e\nCons: Needs SM5.0 most likely, so Urho3D needs to support GL4/DX11. More memory hungry for the 3D occlusion texture but it should be less than the original voxel cone trace system from a year or two ago even without sparse octree’ing it.  It won’t be as performant as LPV, but it would look incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor reflections we could use screen-space local reflections mixed with pre-generated cube map bakes. In combo with LPVs it should look really nice and matches to how UnrealEngine4 is approaching GI as far as I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother idea I had that was inspired by Battlefield 3 and the Enlighten middle-ware was to do ray-tracing on the CPU in real-time and lazy-load updated lightmaps to the GPU. This could be done with something like Intel’s Embree or Blender’s Cycles so it’s still performant but it would only work for diffuse (but more than 1 bounce potentially).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers!\u003cbr\u003e\n-Alex\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:59:41.089Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":13,"reads":27,"readers_count":26,"score":70.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":276,"topic_slug":"real-time-global-illumination","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/~dachsbcn/download/lpv.pdf","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":7},{"url":"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/layered-reflective-shadow-maps-for-voxel-based-indirect-illumination","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Layered Reflective Shadow Maps for Voxel-based Indirect Illumination | Intel® Software","clicks":3}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":69,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":1787,"name":"Alexander","username":"lostintime","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/3be4f8/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-07-02T10:36:40.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eGodot Engine (MIT License) also has GI feature.
