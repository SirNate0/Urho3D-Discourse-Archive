I am a bit unsure if it is qualified as a showcase here, if not, I am sorry and I will delete this post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis game is built upon a game engine I forked from Urho3D. This game engine was initially forked from the Atomic Game Engine, from which I first got to know Urho3D. When the Atomic Game Engine was discontinued, I rebased my fork on Urho3D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Urho3D and Atomic, I have tried a number of open source game engines. I must say Urho3D is one of the best open source engines I could find. If the reasons for which I forked the engine are considered, it is the best and only (these reasons include integration with Qt and easy to wrap for Dao).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow about this game. The game is named \u003ca href=\"http://craftica.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003eCraftica\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraftica is a creative sandbox game with ultra high degrees of freedom for building. It is partially inspired by Minecraft, but Craftica supports multiscale subvoxels so that smoother objects can be built in more realistic scales, and makes it possible to build elegant architectures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraftica also provides a large number of electronic and mechanical as well as other related device items, allowing players to build sophisticated circuits and circuit-controlled electronic and mechanical devices. Players can even build vehicles, aircrafts, robots and computers etc. high-tech objects from items as basic as logical gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/8/84e1ec8967771b27610d7dd1ae5898424cf87c48.gif\" alt=\"Robotic_Vehicle\" data-base62-sha1=\"iXx45BX69mczidof0FfnsG2wcnC\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis game was release on Steam EA nearly a year ago.

Differently orientated shapes are considered as different subvoxels, there are exactly 28 types of subvoxels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handling of them is indeed much more complicated than just handling the full cube as voxel. But due to their symmetry, many places in the various handling of them can actually be simplified.
