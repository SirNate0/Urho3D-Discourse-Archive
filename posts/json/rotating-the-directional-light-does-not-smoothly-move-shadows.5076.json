One downside of chopping up geometry into smaller pieces, is that it will affect batching, unless the renderer is clever enough to use render buckets to catch piecemeal the results from high level rendering objects. It appears that Urho may have some room for improvement in terms of batching, but I am no expert in Urho, I speak from experience across a bunch of engines, and noting that the batch count went up,
