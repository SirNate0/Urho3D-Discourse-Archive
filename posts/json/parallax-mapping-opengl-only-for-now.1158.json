Only material quality 2 lets you change the iteration count. If it’s slow on your machine, the dynamic iteration count could be slowing it down, so try toggling the material quality with the 2 key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eParameter explanations + Tips for using in a game\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe material parameters are:\u003cbr\u003e\nParallaxDisplacement- displacement factor- should be pretty low, I used .045\u003cbr\u003e\nParallaxIters - number of iterations (controls overall quality)\u003cbr\u003e\nOffsetLimit - Value between 0 and 1. Higher values flatten the details at grazing angles, to reduce texture swimming artifacts. There’s never any reason to go below .15 or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re having texture swimming artifacts, you can do one of 3 things: decrease the displacement factor, increase the iterations, or increase the offset limiting factor. Actually, one other thing to do is filter the displacement map to reduce high-frequency features. Maps with a lot of strong, small detail are more prone to artifacts, and usually tend to not make such great displacement maps in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eImportant:\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you’re using one of the techniques with a fixed iteration count, the ParallaxIters parameter still needs to be set correctly to get consistent results.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e This sounds like a strange requirement, but there’s a reason for it. If you’re using different fixed iteration counts for different material quality and LOD levels, then ParallaxIters should be set to the iteration count of the highest quality technique used. The shader will use this information to scale the displacement along with the iteration count to avoid texture swimming. For instance, if your highest setting uses 4 iterations (and thus ParallaxIters) is set to 4, but the current mat quality/lod level uses only 2 iterations, then the displacement factor will be scaled by 50% (2/4) to compensate for the reduced iteration count. If you don’t want displacement scaling (i.e. you want the displacement factor to be be consistent across all quality/lod levels, at the cost of swimming artifacts), then you should set ParallaxIters equal to number of iterations of the current quality/lod level, not the maximum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eSummary of techniques\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe ParallaxStonesDemoVer.xml material (used in the demo) and the  DiffNormalSpecParallaxDemoVer.xml technique that it uses aren’t intended to be used in a real game. The dynamic iteration count, while good for testing different settings, adds unnecessary overhead. So use one of the fixed Iteration techniques instead (DiffNormalSpecParallax1Iters, as well as the 2Iters, 4Iters, and 6Iters versions) (ParallaxStones.xml is an example material that uses these techniques).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shader expects the displacement map to be in the emissive texture channel (so do this in the material xml file: ). So you normally can’t use parallax mapping and an emissive map at the same time. But if you do need an emissive map, use one of the techniques ending in “AlphaPackedDisp”, where the displacement is instead taken from the alpha channel of the diffuse map, and the diffuse alpha is set to 1 (although per-material alpha settings work fine). Packing the displacement into the diffuse alpha channel also has the added benefit of saving a lot of VRAM if compressed with the DXT5 format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eShader Defines\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThese are shader defines you can set from within a technique xml file to control shader behavior.\u003cbr\u003e\n-The vertex and pixel shader define “PARALLAX” enables parallax mapping.\u003cbr\u003e\n-The pixel shader defines ITERS_1 through ITERS_8 will set the number of iterations to be fixed at that value. If you don’t use an ITERS_(N) define, then the shader parameter “ParallaxIters” will be used\u003cbr\u003e\ninstead (dynamic, but slower)\u003cbr\u003e\n-The pixel shader define DISPFROMALPHA will make the shader take the displacement value from the alpha channel of the diffuse map (by default it’s taken from the emit map, specifically the green channel).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crap, that was a lot of text. Let me know if you thought my explanations and different pre-made techniques were useful.
