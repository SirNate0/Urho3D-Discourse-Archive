Since C++ is a compiled language, people tend to use the therm \u003ccode\u003eprogramming\u003c/code\u003e. And \u003ccode\u003escripting\u003c/code\u003e is mostly used for interpreted languages like python, php, javascript or lua and angelscript for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I follow these rules, then I’ll interpret your question as: You want to compile Urho with either regular C++ or C++11 but you’d like to use C++14/17 in your source files. And you can totally do that if you want to. Urho shouldn’t have any issues with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis becomes a bit harder to do when you want to do it from the build system. Since I haven’t seen an option with which standard you want to choose. Just pick whether you want C++11. Which means you’ll have to modify a few files to get that working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd based on the other information you gave. I assume you want to have your files be compiled by Urho’s build system.
