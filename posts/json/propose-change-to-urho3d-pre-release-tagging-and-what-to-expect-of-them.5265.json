Still, the community has not stopped contributing to the project, albeit at much slower pace and (some might say) in lower quality. In the past it was also Lasse who assessed the readiness of the master branch before tagging it for release. So now I would like propose a change to make the quality of release becomes the responsibility of the community itself. English is not my primary language, so I hope I get my points across correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe change should actually bring Urho3D project closer to other OSS  project doing the releases. Instead of tagging the master branch when it is deemed ready, it will be tagged as often as possible. The postfix of the tag (’-ALPHA’ or '-BETA or ‘-RC’) or the absence of it will indicate the maturity of the tags. In other words, do not expect future tags to always work out of the box for you, but instead you are encouraged to test out the tags against your own use case and platform, and send back bug fixes as PR timely if you want them to get fixed and incorporated in the next release. On the maintainer side, this tagging often does not actually add any significant work because our release/tagging deployment mechanism is already fully scripted/automated. And since the maintainers will be freed from the burden for the quality assurance, we would not hesitate to “click the button” for tagging more often than in the past. In the end of the day it is the responsibility of ALL to get the release right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of you do not want to build on top a moving ground and avoid master branch. I have observed the download stats for release tag is always higher than the snapshot on any release (not just 1.7). So having a pre-release tag should hopefully address the concerns of these peoples. Getting the tags constantly push out should also give the impression that the project is still alive and hopefully that could attract a right person to fill the vacancy.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-06-30T07:32:40.307Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":70,"readers_count":69,"score":234.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":5265,"topic_slug":"propose-change-to-urho3d-pre-release-tagging-and-what-to-expect-of-them","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":12}],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":30482,"name":"Leith Ketchell","username":"Leith","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/leith/{size}/2384_2.png","created_at":"2019-06-30T08:19:51.793Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eLasse has stepped down, but he has not left!
