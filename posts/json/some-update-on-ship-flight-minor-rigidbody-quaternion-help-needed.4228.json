If anyone can help. I was able to create a flyable ship in both a zero gravity and artificial gravity environment. Seen the video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe issue is  I’m trying to implement a complete stop in a zero gravity in the script. The vehicle has a auto-balance code that use quaternions to balance. I create a quaternion identity of the ship multipilied by a quaternion of the yaw with the up angle. Then I use the quaternion produced from getting the inverse of the current ship rotation. Ironically, it works. In a environment simulated gravity it functions but if I put the same ship i a zero gravity environment then do a complete stop of linear and angular velocity to zero. The  balance code produces still a rotation very small but if disabled the ship dead stops as intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLine 311-362 and ToAngleAxis on the bottom is the basic part that
