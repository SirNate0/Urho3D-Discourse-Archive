Try to download using direct link provided by \u003ca href=\"http://SF.net\"\u003eSF.net\u003c/a\u003e. Try to download using other mirrors that you haven’t tried so far. Perhaps US mirrors instead of local ones although it would be slower probably. Try to use a CLI instead of GUI to download. I would recommend “aria2”, “wget”, “curl” (in that order). The first two knows how to follow “HTTP redirects” automatically, while the third has to be told by passing “-L” option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also double checked the settings in the Admin page.
