I played with 3D geometry and using Urho3D various classes, it was quite touchy but funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space ship (the black one) can be controlled using a joystick (this is really recommended) and it is possible to go through the gates that have flashing lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many features that I would like to add in that game, and for the moment, I detect collision between the spaceship and the gates. However, I am thinking at a good way to detect if the spaceship goes through the gates (without colliding them). For that, I have thought to add an invisible cube inside each gate and detect collision between those cubes and the spaceship but I do not want any action on the ship trajectory due to the collision (no physical reaction). Any better idea and feedback is welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you enjoy that short video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegards !\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-10-29T16:08:20.974Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":56,"reads":76,"readers_count":75,"score":370.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":3620,"topic_slug":"spacegates-simulation-preview","display_username":"Charles","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":4,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://ingels.me/~charles/videos/hud.mp4","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":136},{"url":"http://ingels.me/~charles/videos/blackswann_final.mp4","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":46},{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/female-and-male-voices-for-game-radio-communications/3643","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"Female and male voices for game radio communications","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":3}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":527,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":21060,"name":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","username":"Modanung","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/modanung/{size}/3290_2.png","created_at":"2017-09-30T14:14:14.176Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eFor the gates you could add a trigger node, add a \u003ccode\u003eRigidBody\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eCollisionShape\u003c/code\u003e to it and then call \u003ccode\u003eSetTrigger(true)\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eSetKinematic(true)\u003c/code\u003e on this \u003ccode\u003eRigidBody\u003c/code\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt will then not be influenced by physics and not collide physically.
