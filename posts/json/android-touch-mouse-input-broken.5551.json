So my initial concerns about the += being wrong were unfounded, but there is still a problem with the samples starting spinning horizontally very quickly because of the mouse move being incorrect (possibly just in the virtual device, I haven’t tried a real device yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe log printing the mouse move over the first few frames of sample 07_Billboards.as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eI/Urho3D: Yaw pre mouse move: 0\n        mouse move: 2921.7\n    Yaw post mouse move: 2921.7\nI/Urho3D: Yaw pre mouse move: 2921.7\n        mouse move: 1.13416e+08\n    Yaw post mouse move: 1.13419e+08\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e–My Original Post–\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least when running on an x86_64 virtual device, there seem to be some problems with AngelScript on Android. When running the angelscript samples, the camera tends to swing wildly, which may be a symptom of the same problem (I’m not certain).

Not sure what’s causing that, possibly something to do with the touch screen input…? In any case, once I move the camera, it seems to stop, so it’s probably okay. Either way, though, it does seem that the yaw changes about twice the amount it should when it had the touch delta
