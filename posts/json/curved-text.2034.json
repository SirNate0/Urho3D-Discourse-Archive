It seems like it would be ideal to use the text_ (and using the uiVertexData positions), private member variable to achieve this however there’s currently no possible way to access that variable outside of the class. Perhaps there’s another way? Using Text3D::GetRawData() just returns null so I’m not sure of another alternative to accomplish this.

Later tonight I’ll create a repo and post what I have so far, but it’s not perfect. Maybe someone out there can perfect it though!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne note however, I have noticed that values I get from Unity and Urho using the Vector math methods are different. To resolve this I’ve been using the glm library for all vector/quaternion math. An example is when you have the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eVector3 dir = (0, 0, 0);\nVector3 up = Vector3::UP;\nfloat angle Angle(dir, up)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll either get back 0 or nan (can’t remember) for the angle. However Unity will translate this as 90.0 degrees. GLM returns back in radians, however once you convert it you would see that it returns 90 degrees as well. Not sure if I did something wrong but I just ended up using glm to be the happy medium in my port from Unity to Urho. Perhaps Urho was also returning radians and I just didn’t notice heh \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT:\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you see here \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/Math/Vector3.h#L232\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003ehttps://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/Math/Vector3.h#L232\u003c/a\u003e it will find the magnitude of the dir and so you end up with a n / 0 case.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:12:27.301Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":15.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":2034,"topic_slug":"curved-text","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/Math/Vector3.h#L232","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Urho3D/Vector3.h at master · urho3d/Urho3D · GitHub","clicks":2}],"read":true,"user_title":"","bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":461,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":12177,"name":"","username":"Victor","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/v/3e96dc/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-05-21T05:10:50.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eStill working out some issues, so I probably won’t have any examples soon.
