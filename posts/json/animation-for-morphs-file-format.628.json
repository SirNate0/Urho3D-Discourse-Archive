Using Urho3D’s current format you’d just grab the morph data and procedurally build a texture atlas from it and then bind it to some texture unit and in the vertex shader do some GLSL index and lerp magic off the base position of the verts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way is to embed the different morphs into empty attribute data elements in your vertex buffer and just lerp them from your base position element in the shader. You’ll just be limited to a very tiny amount of them (typical mobile GPUs can store up to 8-16, and typically you’d use a few of them for the normals/tangents/pos/texcoords/skinbinds/etc.)\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":11,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:48.070Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":54,"readers_count":53,"score":10.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":628,"topic_slug":"animation-for-morphs-file-format","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":69,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3463,"name":"","username":"codingmonkey","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/codingmonkey/{size}/119_2.png","created_at":"2014-12-06T15:02:43.000Z","cooked":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGPU-friendly way of doing morphs for DX9/GL2.x, but it involves vertex texture fetch support\u003cbr\u003e\nit’s good idea in this case engine must setup or choice render strategy on fly or in start time.\u003cbr\u003e\nif device support texture fech it use them, if this feature is not supported it use cpu-based morfs. i think this is right way, because it support old and modern devices.\u003cbr\u003e\nat last may be the right way will be lie in the fact that refuse to support very old hardware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand finally, I think that the shape keys and vertex animation even tighter and use one technology, but in fact two different things.\u003cbr\u003e\nif you want long animation of vertex then it is the task of the new component VertexAnimation, i guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eps. and in addition I want to note that the shapekeys need support negative values.
