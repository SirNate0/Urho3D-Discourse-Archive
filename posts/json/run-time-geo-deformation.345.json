Instead you either Lock() a data range to acquire a pointer to it, after which you can manipulate it, then Unlock() to apply to the actual GPU vertex buffer. Alternatively you can use the buffer’s SetData() operation. In both cases you’ll have to understand the data layout and manipulate the underlying raw data, eg. position would be 3 consecutive floats, followed by other vertex elements. Use GetElementMask() on the buffer to know which vertex elements it contains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen using models and vertex buffers for runtime geometry manipulation, what will come to bite you next is that manipulating a Model affects all drawable objects which are using it.
