And, also it requires a manual correction that is currently undocumented for Windows host. As I recall it, I could not get the Android Gradle plugin to setup the “assets” directory as I originally wanted that works for Linux/macOS/Windows. I have mentioned my ordeal in this forum somewhere, but you will have to go search for it yourself. Suffice to say, in the end I have to live it with a working out of the box solution for Linux and macOS only because it relies on the concept of “symbolic link”, which Windows host does not support (no, I am not referring to mklink). Obviously I don’t want to check in the same assets twice in different places in our GitHub project. But either I am stupid or the Android plugin is stupid that I cannot declaratively split the content of the “bin” directory so that the “CoreData” go to one place (\u003ccode\u003eandroid/urho3d-lib/src/main/assets\u003c/code\u003e) and the “Data” go to another (\u003ccode\u003eandroid/launcher-app/src/main/assets\u003c/code\u003e). Why I mentioned this will be apparent shortly. I gave up and took a shortcut by making them as symbolic links.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time I was developing the new Android build system based on Gradle so that it would work with Android Studio, I have decided not to change the existing Urho3D project by too much. However, I was ambitious enough to want to have a separation between building the Urho3D library as AAR and building the Urho3D demo as Android app that depends on this AAR. So, where is the problem, you may ask. Well, you see Urho3D project has always provided the assets in the “CoreData” and “Data” (we can ignore “Autoload” for this discussion) relative to the project root. I have chosen to “CoreData” to be packaged inside the AAR, while the “Data” to be in the downstream app. Note that downstream app can put anything inside this “Data” directory in theory, not just the one provided by the Urho3D project. When building the app with the Urho3D AAR, the Gradle build system will automatically try to merge the assets directory found in the AAR with the one found in the individual app. Thus, the error you got looks like you have “CoreData” to be made available in both AAR side and the app side. This could happen if you have replaced the “symlinks” that I mentioned above wrongly. Make sure you copy the “bin/CoreData” only to the “urho3d-lib”, while “bin/Data” only to “launcher-app”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHTH\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-08-26T09:41:16.568Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":27,"reads":26,"readers_count":25,"score":145.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":6978,"topic_slug":"creating-first-urhoapp-project-on-windows-to-android","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":43433,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2021-08-26T10:34:25.794Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"weitjong\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"6978\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/40/4_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e weitjong:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit relies on the concept of “symbolic link”, which Windows host does not support (no, I am not referring to mklink).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been trying to figure out the answer on Google for half an hour, but what are the relevant differences that makes the Windows symbolic links/directory junctions not a suitable alternative for the build system?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-08-26T10:34:25.794Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":4,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":23,"readers_count":22,"score":4.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":6978,"topic_slug":"creating-first-urhoapp-project-on-windows-to-android","display_username":"SirNate0","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":628,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":43434,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2021-08-26T10:46:46.536Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWell, the symlinks are actually checked in into git repository.
