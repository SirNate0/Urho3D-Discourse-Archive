Node A itself is locally scaled to Vector3.One, but is scaled to that world scale by its own parent in this context. I’d like to attach Node \u003cem\u003eB\u003c/em\u003e to Node A as a child. When I set Node B as a child of Node A, its scale is modified by the parent scale, as expected. However, if I use SetWorldScale to force Node B back to its original scale, that doesn’t happen. Instead Node B is scaled to some new set of values seemingly still modified by the parent. This doesn’t seem like expected behavior, am I doing something wrong? I’ve included a detailed snippet below showing the problem. My head is really spinning on this one and I’d greatly appreciate the advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eNode nodeA = Scene.AddChild();\nnodeA.SetWorldScale(new Vector3(3.2f,.2f,.2f);\nNode nodeB = Scene.AddChild();\nnodeB.SetWorldScale(Vector3.One);\n\nvar originalWScale = nodeB.WorldScale;\nvar originalLScale = nodeB.Scale;\n\nnodeB.ChangeParent(nodeA);\n\nSystem.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($\"Pre Reset: {originalScale} {originalLocalScale} {nodeB.WorldScale} {nodeB.Scale}\");\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePre Reset: (0.9999999, 0.9999999, 0.9999999) (1, 1, 1) (0.525, 0.4199999, 0.0462) (1, 1, 1)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003ethis.Node.SetWorldScale(originalScale);\nSystem.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($\"Post Reset: {originalScale} {originalLocalScale}{nodeB.WorldScale} {nodeB.Scale});\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePost Reset: (0.9999999, 0.9999999, 0.9999999) (1, 1, 1) (0.9999999, 9.090908, 0.11) (1.904762, 21.64502, 2.380952)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI set nodeB’s world scale, which should be unmodified by its place in the hierarchy, to (.999,.999,.999).
