I was thinking the blender-like approach of drawing outlines to the unit would probably be the best way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried searching internet and it seems there are several kinds of answers to this. One would be making a copy and scaling the object along its faces normals, then flip the faces, and another one seems to be some sort of shader magic. Probably same thing but just done in shaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I was wondering would it make a difference if I make a mobile game? I am only planning on having one object selected at time. Shader thing if I ever figure out how to do it, seems more generic, but would there be a lot of impact in terms of performance compared to just duplicating the mesh and making it solid color then flipping normals?
