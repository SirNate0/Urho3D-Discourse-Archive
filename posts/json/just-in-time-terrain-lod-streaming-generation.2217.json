I want to create a procedural terrain with a 10km draw distance and detail down to a few centimeters. I can’t feasibly generate a heightmap for the entire terrain (it would consume too much memory anyway). So I thought I could generate patches of the terrain at the appropriate LOD level on an as-needed basis. It seems like the terrain API allows for connecting multiple sub-terrains with the neighbor terrain functionality. Could this be used to do what I want? If not, I’d be willing to roll my own solution, but would appreciate some pointers on how to do so (i’d rather do it by extending the engine than some bolted-on solution, but I wouldn’t know where to begin).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:14:00.054Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":84,"reads":18,"readers_count":17,"score":425.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":2217,"topic_slug":"just-in-time-terrain-lod-streaming-generation","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":264,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":13441,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2016-08-30T07:06:38.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eYou can instantiate new terrains into the scene (with suitable size) and join them as neighbors to ensure the LOD transitions at edges don’t bug, but every terrain “piece” you create this way has to be in the same resolution, practically the highest resolution, for the neighbor transition to work properly.
