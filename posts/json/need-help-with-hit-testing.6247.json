I have it mostly working now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to detect taps on the billboard items.  It seems I need to use RAY_TRIANGLE rather than RAY_AABB for this to work.  If using RAY_AABB, I get a hit if I tap anywhere in the billboardSet’s volume and the SubObject is always null.  If I use RAY_TRIANGLE, I only get a hit when tapping on a billboard and SubObject will contain the index of the tapped billboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I do have one additional problem.  The billboards in this case can be somewhat small (they represent deep sky objects in our Galaxy).  They are hard to tap when small.  I was hoping I could use the Aabb option and just increase the size of the bounding box.  That doesn’t seem like an option given what I said above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will either have to make the billboard larger and fill the periphery with transparent pixels, or I will need to do my own hot testing.  Any thoughts on how to write my own RaycastSingle that detects a hit on a slightly larger area than the triangles?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-07-07T14:51:25.543Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":16,"readers_count":15,"score":8.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":6247,"topic_slug":"need-help-with-hit-testing","display_username":"Bill
