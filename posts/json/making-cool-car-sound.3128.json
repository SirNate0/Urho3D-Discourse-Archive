For example, 800-1200 RPM, 1200-2000, and so on. Depending on the RPM of the engine, you play the sound for that range (or a list of sounds so it doesn’t sound monotonic and use some random function) and change the sound pitch. Sound for 800-1200 would be 1000 RPM, if you are running at 800, you pitch down the sound 10% of its speed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSame as above, attach the sound to the moving car. Do some sound effect over maybe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSame as above, car that passes the player has its sound attached to it, player’s car has its own sound attached to it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can simplify step 1 with having only one RPM range (800-8000) and one sound, then pitch it up and down depending on the RPM speed but it would sound kinda boring. Changing gears is simple - every gear has some range of engine RPM, say gear 1 800-3000, gear 2 1000-3000, gear 3 1000-4000 and so on.

High RPM means more pulling power and cleaner burn, low RPM is more efficient fuel-wise.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen releasing the clutch with too low an RPM - and too much resistance on the driven wheels - the engine stops running.
