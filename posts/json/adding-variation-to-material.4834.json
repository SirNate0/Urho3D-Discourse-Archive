It looks like they sample the floor texture at normal UV and at UV * 4, then multiply again by an arbitrarily-chosen color to try to correct the color which is altered by the multiplication. This technique was discussed somewhat in the old \u003ca href=\"https://api.unrealengine.com/udk/Three/TerrainAdvancedTextures.html#Multi-UV%20Mixing:%20Reducing%20tiling%20through%20scalar%20mixing\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eUnreal Engine document\u003c/a\u003e about terrain texturing as the Multi-UV mixing technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter multi-UV mixing, they then sample another texture, multiply it against the previous result, then they mix this multiply result with the original UV-mixed sample with a mix factor of 0.5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that multiplying a texture sample by itself has a tendency to increase the saturation and can potentially reduce the brightness of a texture, hence the constant-color multiplication your linked article performs. Also, while UV-mixing can reduce the occurrence of local repeating patterns, repetition still exists at the level of the larger-scale UV sampling. One way of getting around the color-changing issue is to lerp/mix the multi-UV scale samples, rather than multiply them. For example, here is a texture mult-sampled at 1x and 4x scales then multiplied:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/b/b8105d03ea01fe6fa1a959f984b9d305217a24c3.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTop left quarter is the base texture at UVx1, top right is UVx4, and bottom half is the result of multiplying them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, here is the same texture with a 1/2 mix rather than a multiply:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/0/0b41d06ad1723d1ca3d0e4e2d3d93b8d355ade33.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see that this method preserves the overall coloration of the source texture.
